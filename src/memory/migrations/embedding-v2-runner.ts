/**
 * Phase 115 D-08 + D-09 — resumable batch re-embed runner.
 *
 * Reads memories that have a v1 vec_memories row but NO v2 vec_memories_v2
 * row, embeds them with bge-small + int8 quant, writes v2 rows, advances
 * the migration cursor. Yields between batches to respect a CPU budget
 * (default 5%, configurable via `defaults.embeddingMigration.cpuBudgetPct`).
 *
 * Discord-active agents have priority — runner skips when `isAgentActive()`
 * returns true. The migration is OFF the response path; it never lands embed
 * cost on a turn (sota-synthesis.md §1.5 async-write invariant preserved).
 *
 * Resumability: each batch saves `last_cursor = lastMemoryId` after the
 * batch's writes commit. On daemon restart the runner picks up where it
 * left off via the cursor — no duplicate work, no skipped work.
 *
 * Phase guard: runs ONLY when migrator phase is `dual-write` or
 * `re-embedding`. The dual-write phase covers the case where ambient
 * agent activity creates new memories that need v2 vectors AND historical
 * memories haven't been re-embedded yet (the runner does both passes
 * uniformly; the only difference between dual-write and re-embedding is
 * operator intent).

 *
 * Yielding semantics: this function does NOT itself sleep — the caller's
 * scheduler controls cadence. The CPU budget is enforced by the SCHEDULER
 * picking a between-batch sleep proportional to (100 - cpuBudgetPct) / cpuBudgetPct.
 * For example: cpuBudgetPct=5 means after 1 batch (taking ~T ms), sleep
 * for ~19T ms before the next batch — keeping CPU at 5% net.
 *
 * Why not embed budget-aware sleeping inside the runner: heartbeat checks
 * are already a once-per-N-minutes mechanism; running ONE batch per
 * heartbeat tick at default 5-min interval naturally produces well below
 * 5% CPU use. Operators can tighten the heartbeat interval to spend the
 * budget more aggressively. The CPU budget knob is documented but the
 * actual implementation rate-limits via heartbeat cadence.
