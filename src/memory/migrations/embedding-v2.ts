/**
 * Phase 115 D-08 — embedding-v2 migration state machine.
 *
 * Phases (transitions are operator-driven via the
 * `clawcode memory migrate-embeddings` CLI subcommands):
 *
 *  1. `idle`              — no migration in progress; reads/writes use v1 only.
 *                           Initial state for any agent that hasn't been
 *                           started yet.
 *  2. `dual-write`        — T+0 → T+7d. New writes embed BOTH v1 (MiniLM) and
 *                           v2 (bge-small-int8). Reads still use v1.
 *  3. `re-embedding`      — T+7d → T+14d. Background batch re-embed of
 *                           historical memories at 5% CPU when daemon idle.
 *                           Resumable across daemon restarts via `last_cursor`.
 *  4. `re-embed-complete` — T+14d. All historical embeddings have v2
 *                           vectors. Ready for cutover; reads still v1.
 *  5. `cutover`           — Reads switch to v2; v1 column kept for 24h soak.
 *  6. `v1-dropped`        — v1 column dropped (post-24h-soak); migration
 *                           complete.
 *  7. `rolled-back`       — emergency rollback to phase 1; v2 reads disabled.
 *                           v2 column data is PRESERVED for re-attempt
 *                           (operator can flip back to dual-write to resume).
 *
 * Transition validity matrix (operator must use legal transitions):
 *   idle              -> dual-write | rolled-back
 *   dual-write        -> re-embedding | rolled-back
 *   re-embedding      -> re-embed-complete | rolled-back | dual-write (retry)
 *   re-embed-complete -> cutover | rolled-back
 *   cutover           -> v1-dropped | rolled-back
 *   v1-dropped        -> (terminal)
 *   rolled-back       -> dual-write (retry from start)
 *
 * Storage: per-agent `migrations` table in the agent's memories.db. The
 * migration `key` is `embeddingV2` (the agent prefix is implicit because
 * the DB IS per-agent). One row per agent.
 *
 * Per Phase 90 lock: every per-agent migration step is its own
 * `db.transaction()` against the agent's per-agent SQLite file. No
 * shared state. Migrator instances are per-agent.
 *
 * Per Phase 99-A lock: migration code MUST resolve agent DB paths via
 * `getAgentMemoryDbPath` in `shared/agent-paths.ts` (CI grep regression
 * pin). The migrator itself doesn't open DBs — it operates on a Database
 * instance the caller hands in.
