/**
 * Phase 115 Plan 03 sub-scope 9 — Phase 1 (no-LLM) tool-output pruning.
 *
 * Replaces tool outputs older than the most-recent N turns with 1-line
 * summaries:
 *
 *     [tool output pruned: <tool_name> @ <timestamp>]
 *
 * Goal: shed conversation-history bloat caused by large tool outputs (web
 * fetches, file reads, MCP responses) WITHOUT calling an LLM. Cheap;
 * deterministic; often sufficient on the response-path before any
 * Phase 2 (LLM mid-summarization) or Phase 3 (drop oldest) compaction
 * fires.
 *
 * Phases 2 + 3 are explicitly **DEFERRED** to follow-on phases per
 * Phase 115 CONTEXT.md "out of scope" line 32 — sub-scope 9 ships ONLY
 * this Phase 1 path. The deferral is mentioned in this docstring so a
 * future reader sees where the boundary lies.
 *
 * Pure module — no side-effects, no I/O, no LLM dispatch. Safe to call
 * inline on the response path.
