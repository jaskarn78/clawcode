/**
 * Phase 999.36 sub-bug C (D-09, D-10) — pure helper resolving the
 * Discord destination channel for a `clawcode_share_file` invocation.
 *
 * Resolution order:
 *   1. If `channelIdParam` is explicitly provided → use it (operator override).
 *   2. Else if a thread binding exists for `agentName` (interpreted as
 *      `sessionName` for subagent invocations) → use `binding.threadId`.
 *   3. Else fall back to `agentConfig.channels[0]` (regular agent default).
 *   4. Else return undefined → caller refuses with structured error.
 *
 * The (2) path closes the Schwab AIP file-leak failure class. Without
 * it, a subagent in fin-acquisition's thread that calls share-file with
 * its sessionName would either (a) get a "no agent found" error since
 * sessionName is not in the agent configs list, OR (b) if the LLM
 * conflated identity and passed a sibling agent's name from the shared
 * workspace, the file would land in that sibling's primary channel —
 * exactly what happened on 2026-05-06 (file landed in
 * finmentum-content-creator's channel `1486348188763029648` instead of
 * Ramy's thread `1481670479017414767`). See PHASE.md sub-bug C for the
 * compliance-relevant context — in a different scenario the leaked
 * payload could be PII routed to the wrong audience.
 *
 * Pre-Phase-999.36 behavior is preserved for regular (non-subagent)
 * invocations: when no binding has `sessionName === agentName`, the
 * helper falls through to `agentConfig.channels[0]` exactly as before.
 *
 * NO I/O. The caller passes a pre-loaded `ThreadBindingRegistry` —
 * keeps this helper pure for unit tests.
