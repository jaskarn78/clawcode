/**
 * Phase 85 Plan 02 — pure renderer for the MCP section of the system prompt.
 *
 * Emits, in order:
 *   1. A `## MCP Tools (pre-authenticated)` heading
 *   2. The {@link MCP_PREAUTH_STATEMENT} (TOOL-02)
 *   3. A live per-server status table sourced from `stateByName`
 *   4. The {@link MCP_VERBATIM_ERROR_RULE} (TOOL-05)
 *
 * The result lands in `sources.toolDefinitions` inside
 * `buildSessionConfig`, which the v1.7 two-block assembler places in the
 * STABLE PREFIX (TOOL-07 — survives compaction-driven prompt-cache eviction).
 *
 * SECURITY (Pitfall 12 closure): this module ONLY reads `server.name`,
 * `server.optional`, and `state.lastError.message`. It NEVER renders
 * `server.command`, `server.args`, or any `server.env` value — the legacy
 * bullet-list in `session-config.ts:289-298` leaked the full command line
 * into every agent's prompt; removing that leak is a side-effect of this
 * plan.
 *
 * PURITY: zero I/O, zero logger, zero side effects. Unit-testable without
 * mocks beyond the readiness contract.

 *   - Forbids "log in / unlock / prompt the user to set up" framing that
