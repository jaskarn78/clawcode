/**
 * Phase 73 Plan 01 — depth-1 serial turn queue + pushable async iterable.
 *
 * Two primitives consumed by persistent-session-handle.ts:
 *
 *   SerialTurnQueue: Discord's TurnDispatcher assumes one in-flight turn
 *     per agent; this enforces that invariant at the SessionHandle boundary.
 *     Depth 1 (one in-flight + one queued). A third concurrent send rejects
 *     with QUEUE_FULL — caller (OpenAi server) maps to 429 Retry-After.
 *
 *   AsyncPushQueue<T>: pushable AsyncIterable<T>. The SDK's streaming input
 *     mode wants an AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>; we build one here so per-
 *     turn sendAndStream() can push a user message into the shared stream.
 *
 * Both primitives are hand-rolled with no external deps; the shape mirrors
 * the bounded-queue pattern already used in src/openai/driver.ts (pendingResolve
 * waiter + FIFO backlog).

/**
 * A pushable AsyncIterable<T>. Items pushed before iteration starts are buffered
 * FIFO; items pushed after a waiter is pending resolve that waiter immediately.
 * end() marks the stream complete — pending waiters receive { done: true };
 * subsequent pushes are silently dropped.
 *
 * Intended for feeding SDKUserMessage values into sdk.query({ prompt: ... }).
