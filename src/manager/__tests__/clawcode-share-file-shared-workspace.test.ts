/**
 * Phase 999.36 sub-bug C (D-11) — shared-workspace regression test.
 *
 * Pins the 2026-05-06 production failure class: fin-acquisition spawned
 * the Schwab AIP deep-dive subagent. Text landed correctly in Ramy's
 * thread, but the markdown file attachment leaked to channel
 * 1486348188763029648 (finmentum-content-creator's primary channel)
 * instead of Ramy's `1481670479017414767`. Compliance-relevant for
 * Finmentum (PII risk in different scenario).
 *
 * Root cause: `clawcode_share_file` resolution walked workspace → agent
 * binding. Two agents (fin-acquisition + finmentum-content-creator)
 * share `/home/clawcode/.clawcode/agents/finmentum`. The LLM in the
 * subagent context passed `agent: finmentum-content-creator` (sibling
 * identity drift in shared-workspace pair). Pre-fix: daemon resolved
 * to that sibling's `channels[0]` and uploaded there.
 *
 * Fix: route through `resolveShareFileChannel` which consults the thread
 * binding registry by sessionName FIRST. The subagent's sessionName
 * (e.g. `fin-acquisition-sub-OV9rkf`) is the unique identity that
 * disambiguates the family — even when sibling configs share the
 * workspace.
 *
 * Test directly targets the pure helper. No daemon spin-up.
