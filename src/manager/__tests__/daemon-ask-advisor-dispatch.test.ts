/**
 * Plan 117-07 T04 — `handleAskAdvisor` dispatch tests.
 *
 * Covers the IPC handler body extracted from the `case "ask-advisor":`
 * switch arm in `src/manager/daemon.ts` (Plan 117-07 T02). The handler
 * has TWO branches:
 *   1. native backend → short-circuit response (RESEARCH §13.11), no
 *      call into `AdvisorService.ask`.
 *   2. fork backend   → dispatch via `AdvisorService.ask({agent,
 *      question})`; return `{answer, budget_remaining, backend}`.
 *
 * Coverage (Plan 117-07 §Tasks T04 assertions A–D):
 *   - **A (fork dispatch):** Agent with `advisor.backend: "fork"` →
 *     `advisorService.ask` invoked exactly once with `{agent, question}`;
 *     return shape `{answer, budget_remaining, backend: "fork"}`.
 *   - **B (native short-circuit):** Agent with `advisor.backend: "native"`
 *     → `advisorService.ask` NOT called; return `answer` contains
 *     "runs in-session" (case-insensitive); `budget_remaining` reads
 *     from `advisorBudget.getRemaining(agent)`; `backend: "native"`.
 *   - **C (default native):** Agent with NO advisor config → resolves
 *     to "native" via `resolveAdvisorBackend` fall-through to defaults;
 *     same short-circuit as B.
 *   - **D (response shape preservation):** All three keys (`answer`,
 *     `budget_remaining`, `backend`) present + exactly named.
 *
 * The extracted handler is exported from `daemon.ts` as
 * `handleAskAdvisor` so this suite can drive it directly without
 * standing up the full daemon. Mocks: `AdvisorService.ask` (`vi.fn`),
 * `AdvisorBudget.getRemaining` (`vi.fn`), `manager.getAgentConfig`
 * (`vi.fn` returning the agent-config slice).
