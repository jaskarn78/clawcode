/**
 * Phase 77 MIGR-07 runtime belt-and-suspenders: patches node:fs write APIs
 * to refuse any path resolving under `~/.openclaw/`. Install once at the
 * CLI apply entry point, uninstall on exit (finally block — even on throw).
 *
 * Companion to src/migration/guards.ts::assertReadOnlySource (the static
 * helper). This module wires the helper into the node fs surface at runtime
 * so accidental new-code that forgets to call assertReadOnlySource still
 * cannot write under the source tree.
 *
 * Static guard: a test in `src/cli/commands/__tests__/migrate-openclaw.test.ts`
 * greps src/migration/ for literal `~/.openclaw/` in a write-context call and
 * asserts zero occurrences — catches the "dev hardcoded a source-tree write
 * path" regression before runtime.
 *
 * ### ESM scope caveat (CRITICAL)
 *
 * Node.js ESM module namespace objects (`import * as fs from "node:fs"` and
 * `import { writeFile } from "node:fs/promises"`) are frozen "Module" exotic
 * objects — their property slots are NOT writable or configurable, so we
 * cannot patch `fs.writeFileSync` or `fsp.writeFile` on the namespace.
 *
 * What we CAN patch is the underlying CommonJS module object returned by
 * `require("node:fs")` and `require("node:fs/promises")`. That object IS
 * mutable, and is the SAME underlying object as the default-export:
 *   `import fs from "node:fs"` → same as `require("node:fs")`.
 *
 * Therefore:
 *   - Code that uses `import fs from "node:fs"` (default import) and calls
 *     `fs.writeFileSync(path, ...)` → sees the patched version.
 *   - Code that uses `require("node:fs").writeFileSync(...)` → sees the
 *     patched version.
 *   - Code that uses `import * as fs from "node:fs"` or
 *     `import { writeFileSync } from "node:fs"` → does NOT see the patch
 *     (ESM-frozen bindings).
 *
 * This is imperfect by design — JavaScript doesn't provide a way to
 * retroactively modify ESM named bindings. The static-grep test is the
 * primary MIGR-07 line of defense; the runtime fs-guard catches dynamic
 * path construction that happens to resolve under ~/.openclaw/ in code
 * paths that access fs via default-import or require.
 *
 * DO NOT:
 *   - Patch node:fs read APIs — reads are fine (and necessary for the
 *     openclaw.json reader, sqlite ATTACH, etc.).
 *   - Leave the guard installed past the command boundary — other CLI
 *     subcommands (status, costs, etc.) may legitimately write anywhere.
 *   - Double-wrap — track `installed` state and short-circuit repeat installs.
 *   - Block appendFile to .planning/migration/ledger.jsonl — the ledger
 *     is NOT under ~/.openclaw/; assertReadOnlySource already permits it.
