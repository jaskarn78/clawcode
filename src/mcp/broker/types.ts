/**
 * Phase 108 — Broker shared type contracts.
 *
 * Pure type declarations + one frozen const literal for broker error
 * codes. No runtime behavior. Imported by pooled-child.ts (this plan,
 * 108-01) and broker.ts / shim-server.ts (next plan, 108-02).
 *
 * Security invariant (Phase 104 SEC-07):
 *   `BrokerLogFields` deliberately has NO field that carries a literal
 *   `OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN`. The only token reference is `pool`,
 *   which embeds the short tokenHash (sha256(token).slice(0,8)).
