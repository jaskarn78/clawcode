/**
 * Phase 85 Plan 01 — MCP readiness handshake (TOOL-01 + TOOL-04).
 *
 * Pure module that runs JSON-RPC `initialize` against every configured
 * MCP server in parallel (via `checkMcpServerHealth`), classifies each
 * result into ready/failed, and partitions failures into mandatory
 * (gate-blocking) vs optional (advisory).
 *
 * Used by:
 *   - `src/manager/warm-path-check.ts` (the warm-path gate wires this as
 *     `mcpProbe` so the agent stays in `starting` → `failed` when any
 *     mandatory MCP can't respond to `initialize`).
 *   - `src/heartbeat/checks/mcp-reconnect.ts` (the v1.3 heartbeat re-runs
 *     this every tick to detect flaps and drive reconnect transitions).
 *
 * Invariants:
 *   - TOOL-04 pass-through: the error string from `checkMcpServerHealth`
 *     flows into `lastError.message` + the scoped `errors[]` entry
 *     verbatim. No "tool unavailable" wrapping. No rewording. Operators
 *     see the real failure.
 *   - Empty input short-circuits: zero configured servers → `ready:true`
 *     with empty `stateByName`. Never spawns anything.
 *   - No logger dep. No side effects beyond `checkMcpServerHealth` spawns.
 *     Keeps the module unit-testable without mocking a logger.

 *   degraded → failed    (still unhealthy after first-flap tick)
 *   failed → reconnecting → ready  (recovery path — next success flips straight to ready)

 * Phase 94 Plan 01 D-02 — extended status vocabulary for the capability probe.
 *
 * Phase 85's `McpServerState.status` ("ready"|"degraded"|"failed"|"reconnecting")

 * tracking whether a representative tool call against the server actually
 * succeeds. Filter (Plan 94-02) reads this field to decide which tools to
 * surface to the LLM; recovery (Plan 94-03) reads it to pick handlers.
 *
 * The 5-value enum is locked at the contract layer — adding a 6th value
 * cascades through 4 downstream consumers (94-02/03/04/07) and requires
 * an explicit STATE.md decision.
 *
 * Status meanings:
 *   "ready"        — connect ok AND representative call succeeded
 *   "degraded"     — connect ok BUT representative call failed (we know HOW it's broken)
 *   "reconnecting" — connect-test currently transient — bridge state, brief
 *   "failed"       — connect-test itself failed — process down or unreachable
 *   "unknown"      — not yet probed (boot pre-warm-path)
