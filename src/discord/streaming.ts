/**
 * Progressive message editor utility for Discord streaming responses.
 *
 * Throttles message edits to stay within Discord's rate limits (5 edits per 5 seconds).
 * The first update is sent immediately for fast user feedback, subsequent updates
 * are throttled to editIntervalMs (default 750ms — see Phase 54 CONTEXT D-05 for the
 * tightened cadence; per-agent overrides flow through `perf.streaming.editIntervalMs`
 * with a 300ms floor enforced at Zod).
 *
 * Phase 54 additions:
 *   - first_visible_token span emission on the FIRST editFn invocation (only when
 *     a Turn is passed through the constructor).
 *   - Rate-limit backoff: when editFn rejects with a Discord rate-limit error
 *     (code 20028, HTTP 429, or discord.js RateLimitError), the editor's
 *     editIntervalMs DOUBLES for the remainder of the current turn. A single
 *     pino.WARN fires per editor instance so log volume stays bounded regardless
 *     of how many 429s hit. The editor is reconstructed per Turn so backoff
 *     naturally resets on the next Discord message.

   * flight (~500ms Discord network round-trip) and the throttle timer fired
   * the next chunk, both calls reached bridge.ts's editFn implementation.
   * Both saw `messageRef.current === null`, both called `channel.send`, and

   * progressively-edited message.
   *
   * Fix: serialize through this `inFlight` promise chain. Each call awaits
   * the previous before starting its own editFn body. Rejections are
   * isolated — a failed call N never prevents call N+1 from starting (the
   * await drains the rejection silently, then handleEditError runs).
   *
   * The chain is per-editor-instance, and editors are reconstructed per
   * Turn, so the lock naturally resets at turn boundaries.
