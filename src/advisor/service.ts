/**
 * DefaultAdvisorService — the provider-neutral entry point for
 * advisor consultations. Owns:
 *   1. Per-agent daily budget enforcement (via `AdvisorBudget`).
 *   2. Backend resolution + dispatch (via injected resolver).
 *   3. Response truncation at `ADVISOR_RESPONSE_MAX_LENGTH`.
 *   4. Recording the call AFTER successful backend return
 *      (matches `daemon.ts:9862` ordering — never charge a failed call).
 *
 * Layered budget semantics (per RESEARCH §6 Pitfall 4):
 *   - Native backend's `max_uses` is **per-request** (caps how many times
 *     the executor invokes `advisor` inside one turn). It does NOT cap
 *     per-conversation or per-day usage.
 *   - `AdvisorBudget` is **per-agent-per-day**.
 * Both layers apply: SDK enforces the per-request cap inside the turn;
 * `AdvisorService` enforces the daily cap around the turn.
 *
 * See:
 *   - `src/usage/advisor-budget.ts` (`ADVISOR_RESPONSE_MAX_LENGTH = 2000`,
 *     `AdvisorBudget.canCall / recordCall / getRemaining`)
 *   - `src/manager/daemon.ts:9805–9866` (current inline pattern this
 *     service generalises)
 *   - `.planning/phases/117-claude-code-advisor-pattern-multi-backend-scaffold-anthropic/117-RESEARCH.md`
 *     §6 (budget pitfall), §3 file map row for `src/advisor/service.ts`
