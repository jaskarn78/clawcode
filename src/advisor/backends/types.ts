/**
 * AdvisorBackend interface — per-backend entry point for one consultation.
 *
 * Implementations:
 *   - `LegacyForkAdvisor` (Plan 117-03) — extracts `daemon.ts:9805`
 *     fork-based path into a function and wraps it. Real `consult()` body.
 *   - `AnthropicSdkAdvisor` (Plan 117-04) — the advisor runs in-request
 *     via the Claude Agent SDK's `advisorModel` option. There is no
 *     out-of-band call to make from the advisor service, so `consult()`
 *     THROWS a documented error (per RESEARCH §13.11). The service
 *     never dispatches to this backend via `consult()`; instead the
 *     advisor turn fires inside the agent's own SDK run, and the
 *     budget/observer pipeline records the call from the SDK stream.
 *   - `PortableForkAdvisor` (Plan 117-05) — scaffold stub that throws
 *     a Phase-118 deferred error. Not selectable in config (Plan 117-06).
 *
 * See:
 *   - `.planning/phases/117-claude-code-advisor-pattern-multi-backend-scaffold-anthropic/117-RESEARCH.md`
 *     (§3 file map, §13.11 native-backend dispatch semantics)
 *   - `/home/jjagpal/.claude/plans/eventual-questing-tiger.md` (Interfaces §, lines 106–115)
