// inline in `src/manager/capability-manifest.ts`) means future copy tweaks
// are one-line edits in a file owned by the advisor subsystem.
//
// Canonical wording is lightly adapted from the docs-recommended Advisor
// Tool timing prompt (see `/home/jjagpal/.claude/CLAUDE.md` Advisor Tool
// section / Phase 117 CONTEXT.md `<decisions>.Claude's Discretion`). The
// adaptation adds the ClawCode-specific note that consultations are
// visible in the agent's Discord channel and clarifies that
// `spawn_subagent_thread` is a separate, operator-watchable mechanism.

//   - `.planning/phases/117-claude-code-advisor-pattern-multi-backend-scaffold-anthropic/117-RESEARCH.md`
