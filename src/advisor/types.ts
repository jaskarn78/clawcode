/**
 * Advisor types — provider-neutral interfaces for the advisor service.

 * `ask_advisor`) and the per-agent advisor backend (legacy fork / native
 * SDK / portable fork). The service owns budget enforcement, response
 * truncation, and backend dispatch. Backends are pluggable behind
 * `AdvisorBackend` (see `./backends/types.ts`).
